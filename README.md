- <b>Background</b>: An engine is a critical component of a vehicle responsible for generating power by converting fuel into mechanical energy. In most internal combustion engines, this process involves a controlled explosion of fuel and air, typically occurring within a series of cylinders. As the fuel ignites, it forces a piston to move, which, in turn, drives the vehicle's wheels. Detecting defects in an engine's operation is crucial for vehicle maintenance, safety, and optimal performance. Machine learning algorithms for engine defect detection is a powerful tool for enhancing the reliability, safety, and efficiency of vehicle engines. It enables early issue identification, predictive maintenance, and data-driven insights, ultimately leading to cost savings and improved performance.
- <b>Purpose of analysis</b>: The classification problem is to diagnose whether a certain symptom exists or does not exist in an automotive subsystem. Each case consists of 500 measurements of engine noise and a classification. The purpose of this analysis is to develop models for classifying defective products and predictive maintenance of systems/equipment through automotive system time series datasets.
